# refugee_map
This is the repository for a directed graph refugee movement map that I am making.


Purpose of application:
This is a graph visualization that shows a sample of the movement of refugees throughout the world.


Python libraries needed:
math
numpy
pandas
plotly.graph_objects   (You will need plotly if you don't have it)


Note: The application can take a bit of time to load, stay patient :)
